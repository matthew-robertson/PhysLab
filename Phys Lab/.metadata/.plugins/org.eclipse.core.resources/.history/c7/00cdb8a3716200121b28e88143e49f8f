Beta 1.5.2
Stable Release, bug fixes. Functionality seems fully added

Beta 1.5.3
>Fixed time displaying incorrectly (in ms not s)
>Added new StaticVariable "clip", the movie file
>(hopefully) fixed axis-text on the graphs. it should scale based on user preference, or at least be 
	a scalable size 20
>Video only steps when plotting points. 

Beta 1.5.4
>Number Picked has become an edittext, allowing the frame to be chosen by a user number input.
>Added a new Preference (EditText) allowing the frameskip # to be chosen. Default value = 1.
>Added a new class WritablePoint, a point without an imageview. This is actually writable to file without an I/O Error.
>OptionsObject was becoming pointless, merged the only useful bits left into the project class
>Fixed file saving. This time for real. Saving is basically just data structures now, not entire classes.

Beta 1.5.6
>Fixed graphs 
	-fixed height and width not scaling properly
	-graphs now connect the points (maybe add an option to disable this, later)
>Move frame skip to preferences, replace that with an EditText that displays the frame selected/allows skipping. (Regulate to 30 fps)

Beta 1.5.7
>Reduced required version from 4.1 to 3.0 (Honeycomb)

Beta 1.5.8
>Target version is now sdk ver. 17 (latest)
>Version required restored to sdk 16, until further tests can be done. 
>Added a main menu with the following options:
	>New Project
	>Open Project
	>Delete project [new addition]
	>Awesome art which took a grand total of 18 seconds to create

Bugfixes: Fixed a lack of video crashing the program
	Fixed junk video displays left in from debugging (oops)
	Removed buttons showing if the mainproject is null on the videoselect activity (shouldnt ever happen now)
	Stepping now pauses the video
	Made a basic attempt at fixing the seekbar. Seems fairly decent, but unoptimized [uses more system
		resources than needed ~230 of videoactivity]
	Fixed the clip being null when reloading a project
	Fixed writing to file as .txt
	Fixed some of the excess updates in VideoActivity (allowing the frameset to actually work)
	
Beta 1.5.9
>Added support for the sd card "/Movies" directory
>Fixed videos not changing
>Slightly Improved layout of videoselect
>Fixed the video not centering on some displays (widescreen), hopefully
>Refined the graph selection
	Removed A/T graphs, because they weren't actually doing anything.
	Added an X/T Graph
	Added a Y/T Graph
	Fixed the scale not saving to disk (rotAngle, anyway)
>Muted music_stream in the video_activity(at least). IE removed sound from videos
>The video no longer steps when plotting points, but doesnt add a point.
>Slightly Improved the error message for no videos found.
>Main menu project creation now allows a project name to be set.
	
Beta 1.6.0
>Removed a dependancy on API16, API Required reduced to 15 (4.0)
>Putting this here, because it matters: "It could play flash videos using software only decoding and rendering 
	of the video - but I assume that you don't have any drivers that work that way. There are no
 	VirtualBox GAs for Android, and hence no access to accelerated graphics, so the practical 
 	outcome is that no, you can't play videos in your Android VM."
>Removed the edittext functionality that lets the frame be set. This was causing a lot of grief and is probably about to be be fully removed.
>Added an actionbar for setting scale,origin, plotting points
>New Art

Bugfixes: Added a few null checks in VideoSelect
		Probably fixed the issue where the origin could be placed over the scale text box.
		Removed the center dot of the origin
		The origin actually uses the right art.
