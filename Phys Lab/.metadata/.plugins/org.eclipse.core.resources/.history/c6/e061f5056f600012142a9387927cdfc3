Beta 1.5.2
Stable Release, bug fixes. Functionality seems fully added

Beta 1.5.3
>Fixed time displaying incorrectly (in ms not s)
>Added new StaticVariable "clip", the movie file
>(hopefully) fixed axis-text on the graphs. it should scale based on user preference, or at least be 
	a scalable size 20
>Video only steps when plotting points. 

Beta 1.5.4
>Number Picked has become an edittext, allowing the frame to be chosen by a user number input.
>Added a new Preference (EditText) allowing the frameskip # to be chosen. Default value = 1.
>Added a new class WritablePoint, a point without an imageview. This is actually writable to file without an I/O Error.
>OptionsObject was becoming pointless, merged the only useful bits left into the project class
>Fixed file saving. This time for real. Saving is basically just data structures now, not entire classes.

Beta 1.5.6
>Fixed graphs 
	-fixed height and width not scaling properly
	-graphs now connect the points (maybe add an option to disable this, later)
>Move frame skip to preferences, replace that with an EditText that displays the frame selected/allows skipping. (Regulate to 30 fps)

Beta 1.5.7
>Reduced required version from 4.1 to 3.0 (Honeycomb)

Beta 1.5.8
>Target version is now sdk ver. 17 (latest)
>Version required restored to sdk 16, until further tests can be done. 
>Added a main menu with the following options:
	>New Project
	>Open Project
	>Delete project [new addition]
	>Awesome art which took a grand total of 18 seconds to create

Bugfixes: Fixed a lack of video crashing the program
	Fixed junk video displays left in from debugging (oops)
	Removed buttons showing if the mainproject is null on the videoselect activity (shouldnt ever happen now)
	Stepping now pauses the video
	Made a basic attempt at fixing the seekbar. Seems fairly decent, but unoptimized [uses more system
		resources than needed ~230 of videoactivity]
